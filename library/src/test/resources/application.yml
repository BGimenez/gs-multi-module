service:
  message: 'Alo teste'


#In the preceding listing, we have configured the service.message for the test by using the default attribute
#of the @SpringBootTest annotation. We do not recommend putting application.properties in a library, because
#there might be a clash at runtime with the application that uses the library (only one application.properties
#is ever loaded from the classpath). You could put application.properties in the test classpath but not include
#it in the jar (for instance, by placing it in src/test/resources).
